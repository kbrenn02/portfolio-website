            <p className='text-start text-xl font-semibold max-w-4xl leading-loose pt-6'>
                My name is Kevin Brennan and I am a full-stack software engineer from San Francisco, California. 
                I was first introduced to programming in college as a one off class, but realized after college 
                that I loved the challenge and problem-solving involved in programming, and the thrill of actually 
                making something work and knowing that itâ€™s helping someone else.
            </p>
            <p className='text-start text-xl font-semibold max-w-4xl leading-loose pt-6'>
                When I moved to San Francisco, I dived into the world of programming and learned (and am still learning) 
                as much as I can on the topic, building any and every project that I find interesting.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section className="max-w-screen-xl mx-auto space-y-3 text-right basis-full pt-16">
            <H1 className='text-end italic'>Why am I doing this (programming)?</H1>
            {/* Add a link that, when clicked, sends the user to the projects tab */}
            {/* give some background on why I like coding and am doing it - make it vague so
            if someone from Deloitte finds it, they don't get suspicious */}
            <p className='text-right ml-auto text-xl font-semibold max-w-4xl leading-loose pt-6'>
                Programming, coding, web development - itâ€™s all so exciting to me, and in my learning, 
                Iâ€™ve only scratched the surface of what can be done with this skill. I see my friends 
                contributing to advances in AI and robotics and medicine and sustainability, all with software. 
            </p>
            <p className='text-end ml-auto text-xl font-semibold max-w-4xl leading-loose pt-6'>
                I love seeing how people are using software to solve big problems and change the world. 
                And I want to do my part - I want to create something that will help the world :)

                You donâ€™t necessarily need to. But if you have a problem that can be solved with code, 
                let me know and Iâ€™d love to help solve it. If you have an idea that has a software component, 
                Iâ€™d love to do what I can to bring it to life. If you want to learn how to program, Iâ€™m not 
                even close to an expert but I can offer a starting point and some background. And if youâ€™re a 
                recruiter, Iâ€™m always open to a conversation ;)
            </p>
            <p className='text-start text-xl font-semibold max-w-4xl leading-loose pt-6'>
                As I said, this excites me and I like sharing what excites me with people!

                I tend to be a bit of a maximalist and say yes to probably too many things.
            </p>
            <p className='text-end ml-auto text-xl font-semibold max-w-4xl leading-loose pt-6'>
                I love spending time with my friends, either hanging out, running, 
                climbing, doing pottery, going to concerts, or trying new restaurants. 
            </p>
            <p className='text-end ml-auto text-xl font-semibold max-w-4xl leading-loose pt-6'>
                When Iâ€™m not with friends, I will still probably be running, or dancing, 
                cooking, playing piano, coding, or reading. There are a few more hobbies that 
                I want to pick up too, but it feels like I have enough going on right now.
            </p>
            <p className='text-end ml-auto text-xl font-semibold max-w-4xl leading-loose pt-6'>
                And of course, I love to travel and will take any chance I can to do so!
